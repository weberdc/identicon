This is a simple little javascript app in a webpage that I used as a learning exercise.
Given some text, it will convert said text to a 2D, symmetrical QR code-style icon of a
particular size and colour. The icon is rendered as SVG, as a PNG on the page and there's
also a link to download the icon. The icon size is not constrained to typical icon sizes
yet (e.g. 64x64, 128x128, 256x256).
